# How to setup the 11th JSOC Missions

There are 2 islands in the same repository so you have to:
- Download the Github repository
- Go to /mpmissions/ directory and copy 11JSOC_Training_Map.Malden into a new folder
- Copy everything from 11JSOC_Training_Map into the 11JSOC_Training_Map.Malden folder
- Go into /mpmissions/ inside the 11JSOC_Training_Map.Malden folder and deleted the other templates in there
- Then compile the mission using pbomanager
